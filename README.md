Featured project — pfa-suitecrm-tests (quick start)
---
This repository demonstrates how I structure E2E tests using Playwright + Cucumber and the Page Object Model. Example instructions below are generic — refer to the repository README for exact commands.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn
- (Optional) Docker if you run services in containers
- Browsers (Playwright can install them automatically)

Quick start (example)
```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/mohammedyassinAa/pfa-suitecrm-tests.git
cd pfa-suitecrm-tests

# install deps
npm install

# install Playwright browsers (if used)
npx playwright install

# run tests (headless)
npm test
# or more explicit (depends on repo scripts)
npx cucumber-js  # or: npx playwright test
```

If the repo uses environment variables, create a `.env` file or export the needed variables (BASE_URL, credentials, etc.). Use the provided config files or examples in the repository.

Selenium / Java projects
---
For Selenium (Java) projects I typically use Maven or Gradle:

```bash
# clone repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-dir>

# build
mvn clean test          # or ./mvnw clean test

# run specific suite
mvn -Dtest=MyTestClass test
```

Make sure you have JDK 11+ and Maven installed. WebDriver binaries can be managed by WebDriverManager or by placing drivers in PATH.

What I can help with
---
- Building or refactoring automated test suites (Playwright / Selenium)
- Designing BDD scenarios (Cucumber) and POM structures
- Integrating tests with CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Full‑stack feature development (React + Laravel / Express / .NET)
- Test strategy, test prioritization and reducing false positives
